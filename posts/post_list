Delta Robot Control (2/2)	delta-robot-control	(10-27-2021) I derive a robust motion control law for delta robots to track B-Spline reference trajectories subject to model uncertainty and sensor noise.
Delta Robot Modeling (1/2)	delta-robot-modeling	(10-26-2021) I derive the dynamics of delta robots from first principles using Lagrangian mechanics and introduce algorithms for computing the forward and inverse kinematics thereof as well.
LOTRChess: Chess Game	lotr-chess	(08-30-2021) I review some software engineering design techniques I used in building a chess game in C++.
