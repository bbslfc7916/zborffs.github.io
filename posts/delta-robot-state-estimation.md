# Delta Robot State Estimation (3/3)
*<p style="text-align: center;">October 28, 2021</p>*

## Introduction
I implement an online particle filter to estimate the state of delta robots to improve controller performance.

This post expands up a [previous article](./delta-robot-control.html) on the control of delta robots. In particular, the algorithm outlined in this article could be used in conjunction with the controller to improve estimates of different model parameters thereby improving the performance of the controller.

All the code is available on [github](https://github.com/zborffs/Delta).
